                Joseph Haydn, often known as Joseph Haydn or Franz Joseph Haydn, was an Austrian composer of the Classical period. He was one of the most important figures in the development of the Classical style in music during the 18th century. He helped establish the forms and styles for the string quartet and the symphony. Haydn was born on March 31, 1732, in Rohrau, Austria, and died on May 31, 1809, in Vienna. He spent most of his career around Vienna and was a significant influence on other composers, including Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Ludwig van Beethoven. Haydn's contributions to musical form have led him to be called the "Father of the Symphony" and the "Father of the String Quartet."
